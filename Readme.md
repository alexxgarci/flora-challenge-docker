# üê≥ Docker + PHP 8.1 + MySQL + Nginx + Symfony 6.1 Boilerplate

## Description

This is a complete stack for running Symfony 6.1 into Docker containers using docker-compose tool with [docker-sync library](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It is composed by 4 containers:

- `nginx`, acting as the webserver.
- `php`, the PHP-FPM container with the 8.0 version of PHP.
- `db` which is the MySQL database container with a **MySQL 8.0** image.
- `symfony_docker_app_sync` to sync files using library `docker-sync `.

## Installation

1. üòÄ Clone this rep.

2. Create the file `./.docker/.env.nginx.local` using `./.docker/.env.nginx` as template. The value of the variable `NGINX_BACKEND_DOMAIN` is the `server_name` used in NGINX.

3. Go inside folder `./docker` and run `docker-sync-stack start` to start containers.

4. You should work inside the `php` container. This project is configured to work with [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for Visual Studio Code, so you could run `Reopen in container` command after open the project.

5. Inside the `php` container, run `composer install` to install dependencies from `/var/www/symfony` folder.

6. Use the following value for the DATABASE_URL environment variable:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://app_user:helloworld@db:3306/app_db?serverVersion=8.0.23
```

You could change the name, user and password of the database in the `env` file at the root of the project.


## To launch the project
### Exercise 1

- *Example 1* (Product A added + Product C added + Voucher S added + Product A added + Voucher V added + Product B added):

    + at `./docker` folder:
    ``` $ docker-compose run php bin/console flora:calculate:cart --example=1 ```
    + or inside the `php` container:
    ``` $ bin/console flora:calculate:cart --example=1 ```
- *Example 2* (Product A added + Voucher S added + Product A added + Voucher V added + Product B added + Voucher R added + Product C added + Product C added + Product C added):

    + at `./docker` folder:
    ``` $ docker-compose run php bin/console flora:calculate:cart --example=2 ```
    + or inside the `php` container:
    ``` $ bin/console flora:calculate:cart --example=2 ```
- Tests:

    ``` $ docker-compose run php vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit --testdox src/AddToCartCommandTest.php ```

#### Expected result
